## con-logger

# Description:

con-logger is a very basic package that can replace console.log in complex
files in order to give a little more formatting and clarity to what is being logged.

Each log will contain the fliename and the line the log is appearing on. If appropriate,
it will print out the data as a table instead of a console.log. Additionally, all keys of
an object will be separated by new lines for readability. All that needs to be done is
npm install con-logger and require it. This will create a function that can be used anywhere
in the file.

# Useage:

```javascript
let log = require("con-logger");

log("This is a string");
// Output will be
// ======filename.extension:line#======
//this is a string
```
